# Overview

The purpose of this software is to be a guide while out on the course for a round of golf! This program is used to track your distance of each hole. It gives some basic information such as the distance from the tee box to the pin, it indicates if it is a par 3-5, along with what hole you are on.

I designed this for a quick and easy guide to help either beginners or professionals out on the course. I also wanted to use this as a guide for anyone who is interested on learning how to golf by just adding the essentials to each hole. For this example, it was set in Pebble Beach out in California.

# Development Environment

For this program, I used CodePen. This website was extremely useful as it had tutorials for almost everything related to HTML. I also referenced the ARCGis website as well since it held all of the information for the layering of the maps that are displayed.

# Future Work

Something that I would like to add in the future would be a GPS tracker. With this, it can track the users location and find the nearest golf club and display information about it.
Another feature I would like to add is a slope indicator. This wouldbe based off of a 3D map and tells the user where the slopes are and what to avoid. For example, green would indicate that the ground is flat. Yellow would be a slight slope and red would be a faster slope if a ball were to land on it.
